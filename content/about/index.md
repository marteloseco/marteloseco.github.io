# About Me

Hi! I'm **Sebastião Martelo Seco**, and I'm on a mission to build profitable software products that people actually want to use. **HC{<oops, should not have been public in the first place!>}**

## From Anvil to API

I spent the first part of my career as a blacksmith - yes, an actual blacksmith. Worked with metal, fire, and hammers for years. But I realized the future wasn't in forging horseshoes, so I taught myself to code and made the switch to software development.

Turns out the skills transfer pretty well. Both require shaping raw materials into something useful, fixing things when they break, and knowing when to strike while the iron is hot (or in this case, when to ship while the idea is fresh).

## What I'm Building

I'm a full-stack developer focused on shipping fast and iterating based on real user feedback. My toolkit includes:

- Web development (React, Node.js, Python)
- AI/LLM integration for product ideas
- Rapid prototyping and MVPs
- Building secure applications (learned this one the hard way)

## My Philosophy

Move fast. Launch early. Learn from failures. The best way to validate an idea is to get it in front of users, not to perfect it in private.

I've had my share of projects that didn't work out, but each one taught me something valuable. That's the game.

## Find Me Online

Check out my code and projects on GitHub:

**GitHub**: [@marteloseco](https://github.com/marteloseco)

I share my side projects, experiments, and whatever I'm currently building. Some work, some don't, but they're all learning experiences.

## About This Blog

I started this blog to document my journey building products and share what I'm learning along the way. If you're interested in:

- Building and shipping side projects
- AI-powered applications
- Learning from failed experiments
- Security lessons (usually learned the hard way)
- Stories from the startup grind

You're in the right place.

## Let's Connect

Hit me up on GitHub if you want to collaborate or just talk about building stuff. Always down to chat with other builders.

Thanks for stopping by!
