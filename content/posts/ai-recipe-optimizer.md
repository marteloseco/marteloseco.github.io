Quick update on a project I've been working on.

## The Idea

Last month I had what I thought was a brilliant insight: people waste tons of money buying ingredients they don't need. What if an AI could optimize your recipes based on what's already in your fridge?

I built an MVP in a weekend - AI Recipe Optimizer. Upload a photo of your fridge, get personalized recipes that use exactly those ingredients. No waste, maximum efficiency.

## Reality Check

Turns out the market wasn't quite ready for this. Beta testers kept asking why the AI was suggesting "milk soup" and "banana salad with mustard." The computer vision model I fine-tuned had some... creative interpretations of what was in people's fridges.

Also learned that most people don't actually want to eat random combinations of whatever's in their fridge. Who knew?

## What I Learned

- Validate the problem before building the solution (classic mistake)
- Maybe spend more than a weekend on the ML model
- Sometimes simple problems don't need AI solutions

## Moving Forward

Taking these lessons into my next project. The good news is I'm iterating fast and learning what works. That's the game.

On to the next one.
