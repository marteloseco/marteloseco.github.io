Welcome! I'm Sebastião, and this is where I document my journey building the next generation of AI-powered applications.

## A Different Kind of Forge

Five years ago, I was a blacksmith. Literal hammer and anvil, shaping metal in a workshop. But I saw the writing on the wall - the future wasn't in horseshoes and wrought iron gates. So I taught myself to code and pivoted to software.

Turns out hammering out code isn't that different from hammering metal. You heat things up, shape them until they work, and sometimes you have to start over when things break. The main difference? My fingers don't get burned as often now.

## Why I Started This Blog

2025 is the year of opportunity. With LLMs becoming more accessible, there's never been a better time to build and scale software businesses. I'm here to share what I'm learning as I ship fast and iterate faster.

The blacksmith mindset still applies: strike while the iron is hot, don't overthink the design, and sometimes the best way forward is just to hit it harder.

## What You'll Find Here

I write about the intersection of development, AI, and building profitable products:

- **AI Development**: Leveraging LLMs to build tools people actually want to pay for
- **Web Security**: My applications are built with security in mind from day one
- **Rapid Development**: Moving fast without breaking things (much)
- **Side Projects**: Documenting my journey from side hustle to sustainable income

## My Philosophy

Ship it. Test in production. Iterate based on real user feedback. That's how you win in 2025.

I believe in building secure, robust applications while moving at startup speed. Some people say you have to choose between speed and security, but I've found ways to have both.

## What's Next

I've got some exciting projects in the pipeline. Stay tuned for posts about my latest builds and the lessons learned along the way.

Let's build something great together.
