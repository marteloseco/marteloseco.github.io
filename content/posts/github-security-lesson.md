This still doesn't feel real.

## The Idea

I built a service where you pay $5 to get an AI-generated horoscope but for your WiFi router's MAC address. Yes, seriously. "Your router is entering Mercury retrograde" type stuff.

I called it RouterScope. Took me three days to build. The AI generated the most absurd predictions and people in my beta group thought it was hilarious.

## What Happened

Someone else launched the exact same thing two weeks ago. Same concept, same ridiculous AI prompts, even the same pricing structure. They got featured on Product Hunt, went viral on Twitter, and made over $2 billion before I could even get my version live.

When I launched mine a few days later, everyone accused ME of being the copycat.

## How Did They Get It?

I had the code in a private repo on GitHub. I created a public fork with just the frontend to show a friend how the UI worked. Somehow they got access to the private repo with all my backend code and AI prompts.

I think there's some GitHub thing called CFOR or Cross-Fork something? Where if you fork a private repo, people can still access the original? I don't fully understand it but there are articles about it ([here](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github) and [here](https://sam-burns.com/posts/github-cfor-walkthrough/)). Pretty sure that's what happened.

## Lesson Learned

If you have an idea that actually works, just launch it. Don't wait. Don't perfect it. Definitely don't put it on GitHub and think "private repo" means private.

The universe rewards speed, not planning.

Back to building. Next idea is already in progress.
