Another one for the learning pile.

## The Opportunity

Everyone complains about meetings. I saw a gap in the market for an AI that could join your Zoom calls, take notes, and generate action items automatically.

Built it in two weeks. Used GPT-4 for summarization, integrated with Zoom's API, clean dashboard for reviewing your meeting history. Even had a couple beta users lined up.

## What Happened

First demo call, the AI transcribed everything perfectly. Generated a summary. Great!

Then I realized the summary included someone's offhand comment about interviewing at a competitor. And another person's complaint about their manager. And someone's medical appointment details they mentioned when explaining why they needed to leave early.

Turns out people don't love the idea of an AI recording and analyzing everything they say in meetings, especially when they don't control what gets saved.

## The Technical Part Was Easy

The hard part was the privacy implications I didn't think through. Legal got involved. Compliance questions. Data retention policies. Way more complicated than just "build an AI that summarizes meetings."

## Takeaway

Sometimes the technical solution is straightforward, but the business/legal/trust issues are the real blocker. Should have talked to more people before building.

Back to the drawing board. Next idea is simpler, fewer privacy concerns.
