Quick post-mortem on another idea that seemed brilliant at 2 AM.

## The Concept

Browser extension that randomly changes the font on every website you visit. The idea was to keep your brain engaged by forcing it to process text differently each time.

"Productivity through chaos" was literally my tagline.

## The Build

Took me about four hours. Simple Chrome extension that injects random Google Fonts into every page. Comic Sans, Papyrus, that weird one that looks like ransom notes - all fair game.

I even added a "chaos mode" that changed fonts mid-paragraph.

## What Actually Happened

Turns out people REALLY don't like when their banking website suddenly appears in Bleeding Cowboys font. Or when their work emails render in Wingdings.

Beta testers reported:
- Headaches
- Eye strain
- "General sense of unease"
- One person said it made them physically angry

Also learned that some websites break completely when you mess with their fonts. Who knew CSS could be so fragile?

## The Real Problem

I built a solution for a problem that doesn't exist. Nobody wakes up thinking "I wish reading was more unpredictable and uncomfortable."

Should probably talk to actual users before building next time. But where's the fun in that?

## Moving On

Keeping the code around in case someone wants to use it as a prank. Otherwise, this one's going in the archive with AI Recipe Optimizer and the other greatest hits.

Already working on something new. This one's actually good, I swear.
